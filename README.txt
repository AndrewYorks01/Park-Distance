To run the program, open the following folders:
bin
Debug
net5.0

Then, double click on the .exe file "Park Distance."

The program will begin by asking you to select a baseline
park. You will first select a region (South, Northeast,
Midwest, and West), and then select the park.

From there, you will be asked to input how many miles
from the baseline park you want to see other parks.

The program will then print out a list of parks within
the given range and print it to an output file titled
output.txt. If there is an older version of output.txt,
it will be overwritten by the newer version.

NOTES:
All distances are given as the crow flies, not by
traveling on roads.

A map is provided and given as an Excel spreadsheet.
Each square on the map represents 30 square miles.
The parks are not 100 percent to scale; this program
is for demonstration purposes only. Therefore, distances
given in the program may not be completely accurate.

Distances generally become less accurate the further
two parks are from each other.
